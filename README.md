# Health, weight and related things

Just my collection of health related tips and tricks... This is my way of collecting "my research" on the subject, and keeping track of what I'm doing. You may also go for some of these!

Don't do them all, or do them all. Pick and choose if you'd like. I'll try to reference all tips to scientific data directly or by proxy.

"*The proof is in the pudding, or rather the lack of pudding.*" - me, 2024-02-18

## Why

**Live better for as long as I live.**

Prevent heart attack, and other life style related diseases.

## Starting point

* Waist: 104 cm
* Weight: 87.2 kg

*Tracking using Apple Health*

## Progress as of 2024-02-18

* Waist: 102.2 cm (-1.8 cm)
* Weight: 82.95 kg (-4 kg) ((Hoping to plateu at ~78 due to muscle growth))

## Current goal

* 90 cm waist (stable for for a week)
* 8/16-diet
* No sweets, chocolate. Chips allowed in good company, seldom, and fair amounts)
* Limit alcohol, test out more good non-alcoholic alternatives! (list to come)
* Two workouts per week
* No time limit - I really want this to stick as a habit for my life!

## Wins

* DONE! 30 days with four rules:
 * No sweets, choclate, chips
 * No alcohol
 * Two workouts per weeek
 * Go to bed early/Sleep enough
 * 8/16-diet (not original goal, it just came to be and I added it)

## (Good) Habits picked up so far

* Read more "on paper" (Kindle)
* No phone in the bedroom (reading vs. youtube)
* Eat really good food, but keep inside 8/16
* Eat greens (Add lettuce, tomato, cucumber, etc. for as meany meals a possible.)

## The list

I'm getting realizations about food and "food". One calorie is not the same as another calorie. A carrot worth of calories is way better than the same caloreis in the form of coke. Our body does not differentiate sugar in coke from sugar in fruit juice.

* Intermittent fasting
  * Easiest for me is 8/16. Eat from 1200 to 2000.
  * Loose belly fat
  * Coffee, water, sugarfree gum is ok
* Avoid eating before going to bed
* Vineager before meals
  * Add 1 tbsp to one glass of water before meal. [Jessie Inchauspé. DOAC.](#1)
* Move after meal
 * Small amount of movement helps catch the free flowing glucose. [Jessie Inchauspé. DOAC.](#1).
* Regular workouts
 * More muscle is good for burning energy, getting old, sitting in office chairs, general health
* Eating order
 * First veggies, then fat and meat, then carbs. [Jessie Inchauspé. DOAC.](#1)
* Limit Ultra Processes Foods (UPF)
  * UPF makes you eat faster, eat more [Chris Van Tulleken. DOAC.](#2)
* Eat less carbs, more green and proteins (egg, chicken, beef, cheese)
* Limit, preferably avoid sugar
 * Sugar is not food
* Limit or avoid alcohol [Kristen Holmes. DOAC.](#3) [Rich Roll. DOAC.](#4)
 * Sleep better
 * Alcohol is sugar/carbs
* Read at the bedside, no phone in the bedroom
* Get enough sleep
* Eat whole fruits

## Non-alcoholic beers (Norway)

1. Amundsen Eazy Peazy Alcohol Free Hazy IPA - Amazing! Prizing is more than store bought 0.5 pilsner...
1. Klar - Good, a lot of taste, good for seafood, taco, ...
1. Heineken 0.0 - Ok, tastes about like the mild cheap pilsner on tap.
1. Brooklyn ...
