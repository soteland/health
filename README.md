# Health and related things
Just my collection of health related tips and tricks..

Don't do them all, or do them all. Pick and choose if you'd like. I'll try to reference all tips to scientific data directly or by proxy.

* Intermittent fasting
  * Easiest for me is 8/16. Eat from 1200 to 2000.
  * Loose belly fat
  * Coffee, water, sugarfree gum is ok
* Vineager before meals
  * Add 1 tbsp to one glass of water before meal. Jessie Inchauspé. DOAC.
* Move after meal
 * Small amount of movement helps catch the free flowing glucose. [Jessie Inchauspé. DOAC.][1].
* Regular workouts
 * More muscle is good for burning energy, getting old, sitting in office chairs, general health
* Eating order
 * First veggies, then fat and meat, then carbs. Jessie Inchauspé. DOAC.
* Limit Ultra Processes Foods (UPF)
  * UPF makes you eat faster, eat more
* Eat less carbs, more green and proteins (egg, chicken, beef, cheese)
